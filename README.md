Supply Chain Analysis with Python

Welcome to the supply chain analysis guide! In this article, we'll explore how to analyze various components of a supply chain using Python. By understanding and optimizing these aspects, we aim to enhance the effectiveness of the supply chain and create more value for customers.

Overview:

Supply Chain Analysis involves examining different elements of the supply chain network, including:

Production
Logistics
Pricing
Revenue
Inventory management
Cost analysis
By conducting thorough analysis, we can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to enhance efficiency and profitability.

Analysis Tasks:

Price-Revenue Relationship:
Analyzing the relationship between product prices and the revenue generated by them to understand pricing strategies and revenue generation patterns.

Average Lead Time and Manufacturing Costs:
Examining the average lead time and manufacturing costs for all products to assess production efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Revenue Analysis by SKU:
Analyzing the revenue generated by each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) to identify high-performing products and optimize inventory management.

Stock Levels by SKU:
Assessing the stock levels of each SKU to ensure adequate inventory levels while minimizing excess inventory costs.

Order Quantity by SKU:
Analyzing the order quantity of each SKU to optimize inventory replenishment processes and minimize stockouts.


Cost Analysis:

Conducting a comprehensive analysis of various costs involved in the supply chain, including manufacturing costs, shipping costs, and carrier costs.

Shipping Cost Analysis:
Examining the shipping costs incurred with different carriers to identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize shipping strategies.

Defect Rate Analysis:
Assessing the defect rate in the supply chain to identify quality issues and areas for improvement in packaging, handling, or transportation processes.
